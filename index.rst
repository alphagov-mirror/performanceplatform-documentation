If you would prefer to use our platform API to automate the upload of any data please let us know.


Keeping your dashboard up to date 
=================================

You own the data in the dashboard and are responsible for maintaining its quality. 

If your dashboard is supported by an API then this data will update automatically. 

If your dashboard is supported by spreadsheet data you’ll need to regularly upload current data which will then automatically display in the dashboard. You do this using a GOV.UK Sign on account, which we can create/update for you.
