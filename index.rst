Get a Performance Platform dashboard
####################################

This page explains how to get a dashboard on the `Performance Platform <https://www.gov.uk/performance/services>`_.

A published dashboard is a requirement of the `Digital by Default Service Standard <https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/digital-by-default>`_, which is required for all services with over 100,000 transactions per year. All services, regardless of size, need to provide data on transaction volumes every quarter.

Before you start
================

Please discuss your dashboard requirements with whoever will be signing off the publication of the dashboard as soon as possible. 

How to get a dashboard
======================

A standard dashboard for transactional services includes `four mandatory KPIs <https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/measuring-success/sharing-your-data-with-the-performance-platform#meeting-the-digital-service-standard>`_.

- Cost per transaction (the average cost to the government of each completed transaction)

- User satisfaction (how satisfied users feel after completing a transaction online)

- Completion rate (the percentage of users who complete a digital transaction once they have started it)

- Digital take-up (percentage of all transactions which are completed using digital channels)

How to get a transactional services dashboard
=============================================

To get a dashboard, email the following information to performance@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk. You can use the same address for further enquiries about dashboards and the Performance Platform.

If you would prefer to use our platform API to automate the upload of any data please let us know.

Once we have this information we can publish your dashboard to a non-linked, non-searchable URL.

When the dashboard is complete and signed-off, it will be made publicly available.

Keeping your dashboard up to date 
=================================

You own the data in the dashboard and are responsible for maintaining its quality. 

If your dashboard is supported by an API then this data will update automatically. 

If your dashboard is supported by spreadsheet data you’ll need to regularly upload current data which will then automatically display in the dashboard. You do this using a GOV.UK Sign on account, which we can create/update for you.
